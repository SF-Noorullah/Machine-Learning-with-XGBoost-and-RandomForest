# Machine-Learning-with-XGBoost-and-RandomForest
We will design machine learning models to predict as accurately as possible the time duration of a taxi trip in new york by downlaoding a dataset from kaggle.
Exploratory data analysis, preparation of data via cleaning and preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning have all been done to reach to our desired machine learning model
